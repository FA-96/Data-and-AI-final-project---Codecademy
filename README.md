# UK Elections and Party Donations Analysis

## Project Overview
This project, completed as part of the Codecademy Data and AI Fundamentals course, investigates the relationship between UK elections and party donations. The analysis focuses on recent UK general elections and explores patterns in political party funding.

## Data Sources
- Electoral Commission: https://search.electoralcommission.org.uk/English/Search/Donations?currentPage=1&rows=30&sort=AcceptedDate&order=asc&tab=1&open=filter&et=pp&et=rd&isIrishSourceYes=false&isIrishSourceNo=false&date=Reported&from=&to=&quarters=2024q123&quarters=2023q4&quarters=2019q1234&quarters=2017q123&quarters=2016q4&prePoll=true&postPoll=true&register=gb&register=ni&register=none&optCols=Register&optCols=CampaigningName&optCols=AccountingUnitsAsCentralParty&optCols=IsSponsorship&optCols=IsIrishSource&optCols=RegulatedDoneeType&optCols=CompanyRegistrationNumber&optCols=Postcode&optCols=NatureOfDonation&optCols=PurposeOfVisit&optCols=DonationAction&optCols=ReportedDate&optCols=IsReportedPrePoll&optCols=ReportingPeriodName&optCols=IsBequest&optCols=IsAggregation 


## Elections Analyzed
- 2017 UK General Election
- 2019 UK General Election
- 2024 UK General Election

## Key Findings
1. Significant variation in donation amounts across parties.
2. Conservative Party experienced a notable decrease in individual donations for the 2024 election, which they lost.
3. Labour Party saw a significant increase in company donations for the 2024 election.
4. Trade Unions donate exclusively to the Labour Party, offsetting the higher individual contributions received by the Conservatives.
5. The flow of donations may serve as a potential indicator of electoral outcomes, suggesting either a clear favorite or a closely contested election.

## Data Visualization
- Created a boxplot comparing average donation amounts across four major parties.
- Developed a table showing total donations by donor type, providing absolute figures to complement percentage data.

## Limitations and Future Work
While the initial analysis reveals interesting patterns, further investigation is required to establish strong correlations between donation flows and electoral outcomes. Future work will include:

1. Incorporating more historical data to identify long-term trends.
2. Applying machine learning tools to analyze patterns and potentially predict outcomes.
3. Conducting a more detailed statistical analysis to quantify relationships between variables.
4. Exploring additional factors that may influence both donation patterns and election results.

This project serves as a foundation for more advanced analysis, which will be pursued upon completion of the Machine Learning course.

## Conclusion
This preliminary study suggests a potential link between party donations and electoral performance in the UK. However, more comprehensive data and advanced analytical techniques are needed to draw definitive conclusions. The project demonstrates the complexity of political funding and its possible implications for democratic processes.
